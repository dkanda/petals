Generate text with distributed **Llama 3.1** (up to 405B), **Mixtral** (8x22B), **Falcon** (40B+) or **BLOOM** (176B) and fine‑tune them for your own tasks &mdash; right from your desktop computer or Google Colab:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from petals import AutoDistributedModelForCausalLM

# Choose any model available at https://health.petals.dev
model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct"

# Connect to a distributed network hosting model layers
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoDistributedModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Run the model as if it were on your computer
inputs = tokenizer("A cat sat", return_tensors="pt")["input_ids"]
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=5)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))  # A cat sat on a mat...
```

## Connect your GPU and increase Petals capacity

Petals is a community-run system &mdash; we rely on people sharing their GPUs. You can help serving one of the [available models](https://health.petals.dev) or host a new model from 🤗 [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)!

As an example, here is how to host a part of [Llama 3.1 (405B) Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct) on your GPU:

🦙 **Want to host Llama?** [Request access](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct) to its weights, then run `huggingface-cli login` in the terminal before loading the model.

🐧 **Linux + Anaconda.** Run these commands for NVIDIA GPUs (or follow [this](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals/wiki/Running-on-AMD-GPU) for AMD):

```bash
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install git+https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals
python -m petals.cli.run_server meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
```

🪟 **Windows + WSL.** Follow [this guide](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals/wiki/Run-Petals-server-on-Windows) on our Wiki.

🐋 **Docker.** Run our [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image for NVIDIA GPUs (or follow [this](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals/wiki/Running-on-AMD-GPU) for AMD):

```bash
sudo docker run -p 31330:31330 --ipc host --gpus all --volume petals-cache:/cache --rm \
    learningathome/petals:main \
    python -m petals.cli.run_server --port 31330 meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
```

🍏 **macOS + Apple M1/M2 GPU.** Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run these commands:

```bash
brew install python
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals
python3 -m petals.cli.run_server meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
```

🔒 **Security.** Hosting a server does not allow others to run custom code on your computer. Learn more [here](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals/wiki/Security,-privacy,-and-AI-safety).

🏆 **Thank you!** Once you load and host 10+ blocks, we can show your name or link on the [swarm monitor](https://health.petals.dev) as a way to say thanks. You can specify them with `--public_name YOUR_NAME`.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

Petals operates as a decentralized swarm with three key components:

1.  **Client**: The user's application (e.g., a chatbot or fine-tuning script). It acts as a "driver", discovering servers via the DHT and routing the model's forward/backward passes through them.
2.  **Server (Compute Node)**: A GPU-equipped node that hosts a specific set of model blocks (layers). It performs the heavy computation (matrix multiplications) for the swarm.
3.  **DHT Node**: A lightweight coordination peer. Unlike the compute servers, these nodes do not store model weights but help maintain the Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which serves as the network's service registry.

### System Setup & Commands

| Node Type | Function | Setup Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Client** | Runs the application logic | `pip install petals` <br> *(Use via `AutoDistributedModelForCausalLM`)* |
| **Compute Server** | Hosts model blocks on GPU | `python -m petals.cli.run_server meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct` |
| **DHT Node** | Coordinates the network (CPU-only) | `python -m petals.cli.run_dht --host_maddrs /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/31337` |

### Benchmarks

Please see **Section 3.3** of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01188.pdf).

### 🛠️ Development

This project uses `pre-commit` to enforce code style and formatting. To get started, install the `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
# Install development dependencies, including pre-commit
pip install -e .[dev]

# Install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

Now, `black` and `isort` will run automatically on any staged files before you commit, ensuring your changes match the project's coding style. You can also run the hooks manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This will ensure your contributions are automatically formatted and aligned with the project's standards.
